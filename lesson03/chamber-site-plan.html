        <h3>Scenario Questions to Consider</h3>

        <h4>Can I promote my event through the Chamber</h4>
        <p>ABSOLUTELY! The Austin Chamber of Commerce website has a very inclusive community calendar. All Chamber
            Members are encouraged to promote their community support efforts, free events, business anniversaries,
            expansions, changes/additions to staff, and free networking events through the Chamber. PLEASE NOTE: All
            announcements are subject to approval.</p>

        <h4>Can the Chamber send me information about Austin and the businesses around town?</h4>
        <p>Yes, though we recommend you do most of your research online first. If you still need information, follow the
            "contact us" information below.</p>

        <h4>Can the Chamber help me with a dispute I have with a business?</h4>
        <p>After attempting to resolve the problem yourself, the Chamber always recommends that you contact us. Although
            we cannot act as a mediator in any dispute, our Members represent our high standards for doing business.
            Complaints about Members are considered seriously by the Board of Directors.</p>

        <h4>Will the Chamber give me a copy of their Membership list contact information?</h4>
        <p>Members are entitled to receive one copy of membership mailing list labels once a year for free (member must
            provide the mailing labels). If you need further sets of mailing list labels, you can purchase them for $25
            and you will need to provide the mailing labels. We do not share our Membership email list with anyone
            (including our own Members).</p>
